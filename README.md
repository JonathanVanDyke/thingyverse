  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>  
    Thingyverse is an homage to the thingiverse website where users can upload and share their 3D printing projects.
    This app was built using
    <ul>
      <li> a Ruby on Rails backend
      <li> a React / Redux frontend
    </ul>
  </p>

  ## Prints
  <p>
    Users can create prints by selecting 'Create' on the nav bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The print creation page allows for file uploading.
    The upload is sent to an AWS table through the Rails backend and stored/hosted in an AWS bucket.
    The user must specify a print title and summary or the print will not be saved due to both model and server level constraints.
    The print create form is pictured below:
